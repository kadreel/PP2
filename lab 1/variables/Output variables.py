#MY GOD PRINT EXISTS! NOT LIKE I USED IT IN THE PAST EXAMPLES!
x = "uwu"
print(x)

x = "u"
y = "w"
z = "u"
print(x, y, z) #outputs "u w u" with spaces

x = "u"
y = "w"
z = "u"
print(x + y + z) #outputs "uwu" without spaces

#also works in math
x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y) #outputs 15

x = 5
y = " John"
#print(x + y) <- This one kinda kills you because string + int = :(
#you can use str(5) tho, like this
x = str(5)
print(x + y) #outputs "5 John"

#Alternatively, with x being int, you can do this
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x, y) #outputs "5 John"
